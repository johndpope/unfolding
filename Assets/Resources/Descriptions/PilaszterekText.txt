The early look of the building can also be reconstructed with the help of the architectural drawings in the Budapest City Archives. The postcard shows its fronts in the 1930s, after the remodelling designed and executed by Béla Székely. The slight differences between the plan and the postcard do not affect the division of the house front by windows and doors. The fluted Doric pilasters run from a base, similar in its proportions to the cornice. Thee cornice itself has a threefold division: the lowest part repeats the forms of the Doric capitals that become here parts of the cornice. Above them the frieze shows some triglyph like elements. Finally, the uppermost part is stepped in and supports the gutter of the eaves. All this indicates that the plan was simplified in the course of the execution, even though the architect and the supervisor of the building was the same person. The window and door frames seem to correspond to those envisaged in the plan.
