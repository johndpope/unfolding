The windows sit on a ledge runs along the whole width of the house front. It is broken only by the entrance door. The windows have a narrow frame but emphatic pediment ornaments: a frieze with a bearded mask in the middle, flanked by festoons with ribbons, and volutes of leaves with a trefoil between them. The cornice of the house is also decorated with arches closed off by little volutes. Every other meeting of two arches is decorated by a trefoil leaf ornament. The decorative details of the house front are characteristic of Eclecticism with many related examples in this neighbourhood. A more exact dating requires further research that might also discover the original building, perhaps attributable to Mih√°ly Pollack.
