This latter design allows us to visualize how the house fronts looked before 1925, for it clearly shows the ornamental details in the axes of three windows and the entrance door. The drawing is neither careful, nor very skilled and does not bother with details. The windows and the door are of the same width with the same pediment ornamentation. It is evident that the entrance was created by enlarging a window. Below each window there is a cellar window inserted into the pilaster bases; these are already the same as what we can see in the postcard. It is also obvious that the two wide windows of the restaurant dining room have been created out of two earlier windows each.
