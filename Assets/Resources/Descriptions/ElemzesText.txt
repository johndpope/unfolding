The postcard shows not only the previous forms of the street fronts but also the surroundings of the house. The Dob Street front had a rhythm â€˜two windows/entrance gate/two windows/cellar door with a window above; a double door opened on the corner front. The postcard shows two windows above two cellar windows each on the Rottenbiller Street side. The entrances are flanked by flat fluted Doric pilasters and such also decorate the side fronts, running from street level up to a high cornice with a threefold division.  The lowest part juts forward and is broken over the pilasters; the middle part forms an arch over the windows. Over some of the pilasters there are lesenes reminiscent of triglyphs. The eaves jut forward. The windows are wide, the wooden window and door frames are of good quality.
