The street fronts of the house show traces of later remodelling that robbed them of their characterâ€•of all architectural details, ornaments, window or door frames that might suggest the original function and the approximate date when this house was erected. It is only the volume forms and measures of the building that may point to its first form. The present stage is recorded on a 1978 architectural plan. Since then an only side entrance door in Dob St. has been substituted by a window.
