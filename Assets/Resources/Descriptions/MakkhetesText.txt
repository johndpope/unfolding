The remodelling of the fronts was, beyond doubt, due to the new function of the house as a restaurant. The inscription Seven of Acorns is clearly visible on the 1925 plan, while an earlier, 1916 drawing of its ground plan does not indicate this function. It shows a store room behind the corner entrance and a room for machinery on the Dob street side. An earlier and partial plan, dated 1892, indicates a shop, while a still earlier, 1885 design for rebuilding, attached to a request for a building permit, shows a kitchen and a restaurant dining room to be newly installed at the end of the Dob street side of the house. This entailed a change in the house front, substituting the fourth window from the left with an entrance door and steps leading to it from street level.
